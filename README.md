README 
======

In the continuation of the working group on documentation which 
met during the BootCamp OSV in April 2016 in Rennes (France). 

Those pages are aiming to propose a free documentation about the OSV Vehicle.

How to contribute
-----------------

Get a large step file on the master branch of this repository and pull request new smaller files constituted from the different parts by using i.e [freecad](http://www.freecadweb.org/)

At the end of this collaborative process, the whole osv vehicle should be (hopefully) fully documented.

From that point it would be then possible to evolve organically on a solid basis toward new free versions of this vehicle.
