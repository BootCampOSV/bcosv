How to contribute

Get a large step file on the master branch of this repository and pull request new smaller files constituted from the different parts by using [freecad](http://www.freecadweb.org/)

At the end of this tedious process, the whole osv vehicle should be fully described.

From that point it would be possible to evolve organically on a solid base toward new free versions of the vehicle.
