The file tabby2.stp is not the original file from [www.osvhicle.com](http://www.osvehicle.com/download). 
It has been slightly reorganized in order to ease the step file splitting. 

The step file of the full vehicle is placed in the level0 directory
All the bloc of level1 are placed in directory level1 etc 

It does not make sense at that stage where the final nomenclature is not well
defined and finalized to adopt a hierachical structure which reflect the whole
system. This choice would be reconsidered later.
