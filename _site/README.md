A minimalist theme for jekyll that's currently used on my website. I'll write a more comprehensive readme in due time. Sorry guys!

## Install
Fork, and rename it to username.github.io and clone!

	git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
	cd username.github.io
	sudo gem install jekyll jekyll-paginate
	jekyll build
	jekyll serve
